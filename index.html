            <p>
                I am a philosopher of science focusing on modelling practices in the life sciences.
                My current academic home is the Technische Universität Berlin, where I am a Postdoc
                at the <a href="https://www.philosophie.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/">Institut für Philosophie, Literatur, Wissenschafts und Techniksgeschichte</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                My previous positions were at the University of Copenhagen where I was part of the project:
                Living Machines? Philosophical perspectives on the engineering approach in biology, at the
                Center for Philosophy of Natural and Social Sciences at the London School of Economics, and
                at the Center for Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh. I did my PhD on the
                structure of explanations in cognitive neuroscience at the University of East Anglia.
            </p>


    <h2>Work</h2>

    <p>My research is, for the most part, in the philosophy of biology and cognitive neuroscience.
        In my work I take a methodological approach which I think can better capture the interactions
        between the different facets of scientific knowledge: exploration, prediction, concept
        formation and explanation.
    </p>

    <p>I believe that fostering a critical understanding of scientific method is part of the appeal
        and usefulness of philosophy. I am also interested in how current cognitive neuroscientific
        research can inform our approach to education within and outside academia.
    </p>

    <p>I try to think about the broader context of scientific research, specifically the ethical,
        political and cultural implications of the way in which neurobiological research is used in
        multidisciplinary projects as well as in medical practice.
    </p>
