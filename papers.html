<li><strong>Structural representations and the explanatory constraint</strong> (The Croatian Journal of Philosophy 13(2): 277-291, 2013.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper argues that a particular class of mental representational based on the notion of isomorphism between the structure of the environment and the internal makeup of the cognitive system play an explanatory role in computational approaches to cognitive processes such as spatial memory and learning. Examination of the modelling and experimental practices investigating spatial navigation tasks shows that these representational notions play an explanatory role in virtue of connecting certain robust behavioral descriptions to how-possible computational mechanisms implemented by the biological organisms under investigation.</p>

<li><strong>The scope and limits of a mechanistic view of computational explanation</strong> (forthcoming in <em>Synthese</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>An increasing number of philosophers have promoted the idea that mechanism provides a fruitful framework for thinking about the explanatory contributions of computational approaches in cognitive neuroscience. For instance, Piccinini and Bahar (2013) have recently argued that neural computation constitutes a sui generis category of physical computation which can play a genuine explanatory role in the context of investigating neural and cognitive processes. The core of their proposal is to conceive of computational explanations in cognitive neuroscience as a subspecies of mechanistic explanations. This paper identifies several challenges facing their mechanistic account and sketches an alternative way of thinking about the epistemic virtues of computational approaches used in in the study of brain and cognition. Drawing on examples from both low-level and systems-level computational neuroscience, I argue that at least some computational explanations of neural and cognitive processes are partially independent from mechanistic constraints.</p>

<li><strong>Mathematics without mechanism: A critique and a proposal</strong> (with Davide Rizza, submitted to <em>Philosophia Mathematica</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this paper we discuss the mechanistic model of explanation and offer several arguments against its applicability to geometrical explanation as envisaged in Frans and Weber (2014). Our critique focuses on the mismatch between mathematical practice and mechanistic categories: in particular, we argue that these categories prove an obstacle to identifying the significant features of mathematical proof. We also suggest that this phenomenon is not characteristic of the mechanistic model alone and that the conceptual analysis of mathematical proof may be hindered by the adoption of a notion like explanation, which emerges naturally from empirical science but may not be as fruitful when transferred to the study of mathematical practice.</p>

<li><strong>Semantic contributions to the philosophy of explanation</strong> (submitted to <em>European Journal for Philosophy of Science</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Philosophical accounts of scientific explanation are broadly divided into ontic and epistemic views. This paper explores the idea that the lexical ambiguity of the verb to explain and its nominalisation supports an ontic conception of explanation (Salmon 1989; Craver 2007). I analyse one argument which challenges this strategy by criticising the claim that explanatory talk is lexically ambiguous (Wright 2012). I propose that the linguistic mechanism of transfer of meaning (Nunberg 1995) provides a better account of the lexical alternations that figure in the systematic polysemy of explanatory talk, and evaluate the implications of this proposal for the debate between ontic and epistemic conceptions of scientific explanation.</p>

<li><strong>What is wrong with the ontic-epistemic debate on mechanistic explanation?</strong> (submitted to <em>Philosophy of Science</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The ontic conception of scientific explanation defended, among others, by Wesley Salmon (1989) and Carl Craver (2007, 2014), has recently come under serious criticism (Wright 2007, 2012; Levy and Bechtel 2013). This paper surveys three related objections concerning the adequacy of the ontic view: (i) the understanding objection, (ii) the generality or systematicity objection, and (iii) the idealization objection. According to its critics, the ontic conception of explanation cannot account for the role that abstraction and idealization play in the construction and evaluation of adequate explanations in scientific practice, nor is it able to clarify how understading of a given phenomenon arises from citing the causal mechanisms supporting or maintaining it. In response, I argue that these objections rely on a strong metaphysical reading of the ontic conception which can be avoided on a more methodological interpretation of the position.</p>

<li><strong>Modelling with ordinary differential equations</strong> (submitted to <em>British Journal for Philosophy of Science</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Supporters of dynamic systems theory approaches in cognitive science and neuroscience have argued that the framework makes available a series of tools which allow the construction of non-mechanistic explanations of cognitive and neural processes. At the core of these proposals one finds the idea that ordinary and partial differential equations constitute the distinctive explanatory structures put forward by dynamicist approaches. Surveying the steps of a simple modelling methodology used in the study of the bimanual coordination reveals a more sophisticated picture of the epistemic roles played by differential equations in constructing how-possible explanations of cognitive behaviours. I argue that the results of this analysis to support a version of the hybrid conception of dynamic mechanistic explanations (Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2010) which captures both the steps involved in the modelling process as well as its final result.</p>

<li><strong>In defense of the explanatory role of mental representations in computational neuroscience</strong> (submitted to <em>Philosophical Studies</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cognitive scientists invoke mental representations to explain cognitive functions and behaviors like object recognition, imagery, language comprehension, and reasoning, while neuroscientists appeal to talk of neural representations to account for motor control, retinal and early visual processing, the self-organization of neural systems among other types of biological phenomena. Despite this widespread use of representational notions, a consensus view about the nature of mental representations and their roles in modelling and explaining higher and lower-order cognitive phenomena is still lacking. This paper extends and refines Frances Egan’s (2010, 2013) pragmatic account of the role of mental representation in computational explanations of cognitive phenomena. Focusing on the modelling of motor behaviours of reaching and grasping in computational neuroscience (Shadmehr and Wise 2005; Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi 2014), I show that mental representations enable the sort of analogical reasoning that is required to connect computational descriptions of particular neurobiological systems to the cognitive behaviours that constitute the explananda of these models. In addition, the emerging account distinguishes between two classes of computational explanations pursued in these modelling practices, thus eliminating some systematic problems of Egan’s approach.</p>
