		- *Structural Representations and the Explanatory Constraint* Croatian Journal of Philosophy 13 (2):277-291, 2013.

		My aim in this paper is to investigate what epistemic role, if any, do appeals to representations play in cognitive neuroscience. I suggest that while at present they seem to play something in between a minimal and a substantive explanatory role, there is reason to believe that representations have a substantial contribution to the construction of neuroscientic explanations of cognitive phenomena. 


		- *What can polysemy tell us about theories of explanation?* European Journal for Philosophy of Science 7 (1):41-56, 2017.

		Philosophical accounts of scientific explanation are broadly divided into ontic and epistemic views. This paper explores the idea that the lexical ambiguity of the verb to explain and its nominalisation supports an ontic conception of explanation. I analyse one argument which challenges this strategy by criticising the claim that explanatory talk is lexically ambiguous, 375–394, 2012). I propose that the linguistic mechanism of transfer of meaning, 109–132, 1995) provides a better account of the lexical alternations that figure in the systematic polysemy of explanatory talk, and evaluate the implications of this proposal for the debate between ontic and epistemic conceptions of scientific explanation.


		- *The scope and limits of a mechanistic view of computational explanation* Synthese 192 (10):3371-3396, 2015. 

		An increasing number of philosophers have promoted the idea that mechanism provides a fruitful framework for thinking about the explanatory contributions of computational approaches in cognitive neuroscience. For instance, Piccinini and Bahar :453–488, 2013) have recently argued that neural computation constitutes a sui generis category of physical computation which can play a genuine explanatory role in the context of investigating neural and cognitive processes. The core of their proposal is to conceive of computational explanations in cognitive neuroscience as a subspecies of mechanistic explanations. This paper identifies several challenges facing their mechanistic account and sketches an alternative way of thinking about the epistemic roles of computational approaches used in the study of brain and cognition. Drawing on examples from both low-level and systems-level computational neuroscience, I argue that at least some computational explanations of neural and cognitive processes are partially independent from mechanistic constraints. 

		- *Network analyses in systems biology: new strategies for dealing with biological complexity* (with S. Green, N. Jones, R. Scholl, I. Brigandt, and W. Bechtel) Synthese 2017.

		The increasing application of network models to interpret biological systems raises a number of important methodological and epistemological questions. What novel insights can network analysis provide in biology? Are network approaches an extension of or in conflict with mechanistic research strategies? When and how can network and mechanistic approaches interact in productive ways? In this paper we address these questions by focusing on how biological networks are represented and analyzed in a diverse class of case studies. Our examples span from the investigation of organizational properties of biological networks using tools from graph theory to the application of dynamical systems theory to understand the behavior of complex biological systems. We show how network approaches support and extend traditional mechanistic strategies but also offer novel strategies for dealing with biological complexity.


		- *Learning from large scale neural simulations* In T. Mahfoud, S. McLean and N. Rose (eds) Vital Models: The making and use of models in the brain sciences. 
(forthcoming)

		Large-scale neural simulations have the marks of a distinct methodology which can be fruitfully deployed in neuroscience. I distinguish two types of applications of the simulation methodology in neuroscientific research. Model-oriented applications aim to use the simulation outputs to derive new hypotheses about brain organization and functioning and thus to extend current theoretical knowledge and understanding in the field. Data-oriented applications of the simulation methodology target the collection and analysis of data relevant for neuroscientific research that is inaccessible via more traditional experimental methods. I argue for a two-stage evaluation schema which helps clarify the differences and similarities between three current large-scale simulation projects pursued in neuroscience. 


		- *Turing patterns and biological explanation* Disputatio (forthcoming)

		Turing patterns are a class of minimal mathematical models that have been used to discover and conceptualize certain abstract features of early biological development. This paper examines a range of these minimal models in order to articulate and elaborate a philosophical analysis of their epistemic uses. It is argued that minimal mathematical models aid in structuring the epistemic practices of biology by providing precise descriptions of the quantitative relations between various features of the complex systems, generating novel predictions that can be compared with experimental data, promoting theory exploration, and acting as constitutive parts of empirically adequate explanations of naturally occurring phenomena, such as biological pattern formation. Focusing on the roles that minimal model explanations play in science motivates the adoption of a broader diachronic view of scientific explanation.


		- *Understanding the organization of cognitive approaches to translation* In Routledge Companion to Philosophy and Translation (forthcoming)

		Cognitive approaches to translation studies are driven by three interrelated aims: to understand the structure and organization of the capacities of cognitive agents involved in processes of translation, to build better theories and models of translation, and to develop more efficient methods and programs for translator training. Meeting the goals of such a broad agenda requires the fusion of different theoretical and experimental tools, from fields such as cognitive psychology, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. From exploratory studies that aimed to carve out the problem space for cognitive approaches to translation through methodologically refined studies based on triangulation and statistical analysis, to large scale projects that promise helpful technological innovations for translation studies, the current landscape of research programs that investigate the cognitive underpinnings of translation is both varied and constantly developing. This essay showcases some current research programs that reflect the fruitfulness of the interdisciplinary structure of translation studies. Instead of thinking about cognitive research on translation as being driven by a master cognitive theory, it is more descriptively adequate and more fruitful to understand it as a family of projects based on multiple theories that are relevant for studying different aspects of the translation process. This perspective allows us to extract the erotetic structure of these programs which are organized around specific problems or questions that have been shaped by previous research, by well-established cognitive hypotheses and by the current interests of the discipline of translation studies. Comparing different studies and models of translation will serve to illustrate how different theoretical and experimental approaches contribute to organizing and addressing specific problems on the agenda of a multidisciplinary field such as that of translation studies.

		- *Modelling biological robustness*

		Robustness refers to the ability of a system to maintain characteristic behaviours in the face of internal or external changes. Robustness has become a major research topic in the life sciences, particularly in systems biology where researchers draw on engineering frameworks to explore organizational or design principles that might support robust properties in biological systems. Based on a comparative analysis of three models from systems biology, we argue that sometimes the robustness of biological properties or behaviours is best explained in causal-structural terms. In elaborating the notion of causal-structural explanations we focus on how a “thin” notion of design is used to conceptualize a robust biological behaviour, namely the perfect adaptation of bacterial chemotaxis. We conclude by showing how our account relates to the mechanistic framework.

		- *Biological robustness: design, organization and mechanisms*

		This paper focuses on biological robustness understood as functional stability in the face of external or internal perturbations. Recent engineering-based modeling efforts in the field of systems biology suggest that the robustness of some characteristic behaviours or properties depends on the internal organization of biological systems. This implies that abstract representations of patterns of organization or design principles are sometimes the main explanatory categories used for understanding the robustness of certain biological properties. We characterize such model-based explanations as structural causal explanations and situate our account in the broader philosophical debate about explanation in biology.

		- *Constitutive relevance in interlevel experiments* 

		One reason for the popularity of Craver's mutual manipulability account of constitutive relevance (MM) is that it seems to make good sense of the experimental practices and constitutive reasoning in the life sciences. Two recent papers (Baumgartner and Gebharter2016 & Baumgartner and Casini2017) propose a theoretical revision of (MM) in light of several important conceptual objections. Their alternative approach, the No De-Coupling account (NDC) conceives of constitution as a dependence relation which, once postulated, provides the best explanation of the impossibility of breaking the common cause coupling of a macro-level mechanism and its micro-level components. This entails an abductive view of constitutive inference. Proponents of the NDC account recognise that their discussion leaves open a big question concerning the practical dimension of the notion of constitutive relevance: Is it possible to faithfully reconstruct constitutional reasoning in science in terms of NDC? Focusing on the field of memory and LTP research, this paper argues that NDC provides a more adequate description of inter-level experiments in neuroscience. We also suggest that NDC highlights some significant practical recommendations of how to interpret the findings of interlevel experiments.

		
		- *Investigating hierarchical modularity* 

		Biological modules are standardly conceived as internally organized structural and functional units which are relatively independent from one another. Proteins, macromolecules, cells, biochemical circuits, organs and whole organisms may fit in this characterization. Still, not any biological part counts as a module, or does it? Conceptualizing different biological structures and processes as modular boosts their similarity to more or less sophisticated man-made machines. This paper explores contemporary notions of biological modularity in order to gain further philosophical insight into the scope of the machine analogy in biology. Current bioscientific research uses networks-based methodologies to further investigate and develop the notion of biological modularity. One converging proposal is that biological systems are organized in nested hierarchies of structurally and functionally well-defined units. Drawing on two recent studies from metabolic and brain research, we show how graph theoretical representations of complex biological systems can contribute to the development of the biological concept of hierarchical modularity. More specifically, we argue that networks-based models can play the following epistemic roles: enable the visualization of the hierarchical organization of biological modules, mediate the construction of quantitative measures of hierarchical modularity, and corroborate theoretical accounts of hierarchical modularity as a gradual property of biological systems. 

		- *Emergence, robustness and mechanisms*

		How common are emergent phenomena in the biological realm? The rise of the mechanistic outlook challenges the idea that biological phenomena are emergent in any substantive sense. Mechanism has a complicated relationship to emergence. Philosophical mechanism stresses the non-reductionist and hierarchical character of mechanistic models and explanations of biological phenomena. This maps onto the \emph{negative} characterization of emergence, but the causal-constitutive character of mechanistic explanations seems to be at odds with the positive features of emergence: the novelty and independence of macrolevel phenomena. Current and past discussions of the relation between mechanism and emergence have overlooked the problem of biological robustness. Some kinds of robustness are not amenable to a mechanistic treatment. I claim that they hold the key to strengthening the positive characterization of emergent biological phenomena. Focusing on a case of multiscale kinetic modeling, I show how the investigation of biological robustness can alleviate the tension between mechanism and emergence.


		- *Computational explanations through a mechanistic lens*
		
		Piccinini's mechanistic account of physical computation is currently one of the most well-developed non-reductionist views of the modeling and explanatory strategies used in computational neuroscience. The key idea of the account is that aligning the notion of physical computation and mechanism helps elucidate the distinctive character of computational models developed in the field and provides insight into the norms for evaluating their explanatory value. This paper explores two problems for the mechanistic account of physical computation: the non-decompositional features of some computational explanatory models used in cognitive neuroscience and the non-mechanistic character of the distinctive features of computational systems.
