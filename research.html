<p>My current research interests cover the following themes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Philosophy of pscyhology and neuroscience</em> -- computational theories of motor behavior, language processing, network approaches to cognition and the brain, the multi-functionality of the brain hypotheses</p></li>
<li><p><em>Philosophy of mind</em> -- computationalism, reductionist views, representationalist views of perception, emotion, cognitive theories of consciousness;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Philosophy of science</em> -- mechanistic and computational explanation, modelling, and experimentation, computer simulation studies, idealization, abstraction, and integration;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Metaphysics</em>: reduction, emergence, mechanism.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brief summary</strong></p>
<p>The aim of my doctoral studies was to develop a framework for analyzing the explanatory structures used by mechanistic, symbolic, connectionist, and dynamicist approaches to cognition. Focusing primarily on multilevel modeling in cognitive neurobiology, I argued that cognitive explanations are often developed at the interface of mechanistic and higher-order rationalistic constraints.</p>
<p>In my current work, I analyze the conceptions of explanatory emergence associated with the connectionist and dynamicist modelling paradigms used in cognitive neuroscience. I also investigate the implications of neuroplasticity for pursuing a modularised approach to the functional architecture of the brain by discussing whether current hypotheses about the multi-functionality of the brain, such as the neural recycling and neural reuse hypotheses, provide alternative idealizations that might guide experimental design and theory development in cognitive neuroscience.</p>
<p>In my future research I will explore three interrelated themes which reflect the ambitions as well as the challenges facing the major research paradigms currently proposed in cognitive neuroscience: (i) the interpretation of data visualized <em>in silico</em>, (ii) the implications of the multilevel strategies used to investigate the dynamics of neural systems, and (iii) the relationship between computer simulations and more established scientific practices such as theorizing and experimenting. These investigations will support a critical evaluation of the benefits and limitations of the two recent research programs (the <em>Human Brain Project</em> and the <em>Brain Initiative</em>) which diverge in their focus on building large scale brain models or on the collection of extensive data about brain circuits at multiple temporal and spatial scales.</p>
