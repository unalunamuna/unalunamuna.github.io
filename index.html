                Iâ€™m a philosopher of science in the School of Politics, Philosophy, and Area Studies, 
                at the University of East Anglia. My research focuses on issues related to modelling 
                and measurement in the social sciences, the epistemology of artificial intelligence, 
                and mechanistic explanation in biology and cognitive science.            
            </p>

            <p>
                My previous positions were at the University of Copenhagen where I was part of the project:
                Living Machines? Philosophical perspectives on the engineering approach in biology, at the
                Center for Philosophy of Natural and Social Sciences at the London School of Economics, and
                at the Center for Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh. I did my PhD on the
                structure of explanations in cognitive neuroscience at the University of East Anglia.

    <h2>Research</h2>

    <p><strong>Values and standards in psychological measurement</strong></br> 
        While we commonly view psychological measurement as a crucial tool for gaining 
        reliable insights into human capacities and behaviour, its widespread application 
        sparks ongoing discussions on reliability. When and why should we place confidence 
        in the results of psychological assessments and tests? In this project, I assert 
        that our trust is justified within a framework of scientific practices. These 
        practices encompass technical scrutiny, interdisciplinary validations, and social 
        interventions, collectively shaping the values and interests inherent in psychological 
        measurement methods.
        
    </p>

    <p><strong>Human and machine creativity in scientific discovery </strong></br>
        Scientific discovery, often perceived as a romantic and creative endeavour, has been 
        deemed unanalyzable, and contrasted with the logical nature of the subsequent validation 
        and verification processes. A renewed philosophical interest in scientific discovery has 
        paved a new way to understand the ampliative rules, methods, and heuristic procedures 
        that make up the human practices of scientific discovery. This project critically examines 
        the ways in which machine learning methods transform and creatively enhance discovery in 
        various scientific domains.
