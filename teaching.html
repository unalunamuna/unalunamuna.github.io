            <h1>Teaching</h1>

            <p>My teaching interests are broad, including general philosophy of science, philosophy of biology and cognitive neuroscience, logic, philosophy of mathematics, feminist philosophy and philosophical methodology. A complete list of the courses I taught is given below.</p>


            <p>I believe that a philosophy education should contribute to the development of transferable skills that can benefit students with different backgrounds and interests. In planning and organizing my courses, I place special emphasis on issues like argumentative structure, critical science literacy, and as much engagement as possible with topics that have theoretical and moral significance in daily life.</p>

            <p>Drawing on the empirical literature on psychology and education, I plan my courses using different forms of guided practice so as to kindle students' interest and involvement with the topics being taught. I strive to develop and apply inclusive strategies which would also benefit students who might face special challenges in the academy. I emphasize the importance of collaborative learning by promoting in class group activities and discussions among peers punctuated by mini-lectures for context and direction. I see the goal of learning collaboratively as that of developing skills that will enable the student to  extend the knowledge acquired during class to other topics and problems.</p>
